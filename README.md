# Random Maze Generator

Here you have a very nice maze generator web application. The algorithm i use is called: Randomized Prim's algorithm.
You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm

You can change the cell size, wall color, enable/disable glow effect, light/dark mode and even create the maze animated.

After creating the maze you can print it and give it your kids to solve it.
